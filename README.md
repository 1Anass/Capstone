# Capstone

In my capstone project, Ibuilt a streaming data pipeline that enables chatbot feature for websites. The pipeline collects
events generated by users in web pages using RxJS library, ingests them in Apache Kafka platform, analyzes
them in real-time using Kafka Streams, and uses a naÃ¯ve bayes classifier to generate assistance messages for users.
